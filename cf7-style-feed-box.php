	<h4>Valentine's Day Templates</h4>
	
	<p>Our latest update released features 4 new templates for Valentine's Day and 
	a Custom style area.</p>
	
	<h4>Xmas Templates</h4>
	
	<p>As a first release, we developed only the basic settings and only 3 simple and nice designs.</p>
	<p>For the next updates we are preparing new options, new designs and new cool features for your forms.</p>
	<p>This plugin will not be just for Christmas, but for every day usage, and with some neat features and designs for holidays 
	like Easter, Christmas, Halloween, etc. :-) In the near future maybe even a Premium version.</p>
